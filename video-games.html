								<p>This video game was developed as part of the 'Videogame Engineering' course, entirely by myself, utilizing various programming patterns to their full potential. I handled every aspect of the game's development except for the music, which was sourced from a public post on SoundCloud and is properly credited in the game.</p>
								<p>I was responsible for creating the game's visuals, UI, mechanics, and programming, ensuring each part fit the project's scope and style.</p>

								<p>This video game is part of a project developed for the course 'Games for Web and Social Media', created in collaboration with five other students under the name Psycoffin Studios. My role in this project included working as a gameplay designer, concept artist, 2D designer, and texture designer.</p>
								<p>I was responsible for designing the game's characters, maps, and props, ensuring each element aligned with the overall theme and style. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/paintball_characters.png" alt="SplashArt" /></div>								
								<p>Every aspect of the game is inspired by the concept of a Halloween costume party, where the characters' imaginations run wild as they engage in a fun and friendly paintball match.</p>

								<p>Additionally, I created the visual identity of the game, including its logos and cover art, to deliver a cohesive and engaging aesthetic that captured the essence of the project. </p>
